# DietSpoon

ShinyApp template for a final project in Operations Research (I√êN401G) Spring 2017.

This Shiny/R template illustrates how:

1.) One uses R to fetch recipies from Spoonacular using their API.

2.) Write key features of the recipies to a DAT file for AMPL (spoonacular.dat).

3.) Sends a AMPL model (spoonacular.mod) and AMPL run file (spoonacular.run) along with the .dat file to the Neos Server

4.) Gets the results of the optmization from the Neos server and displays the results with a table.

The spoonacular.mod file is an example file, but is missing all constraints and objectives for the final project.
